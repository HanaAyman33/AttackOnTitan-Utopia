# Attack on Titan: Utopia 🛡️👾

**Attack on Titan: Utopia** is a thrilling single-player, endless tower defense game inspired by the renowned anime series *Attack on Titan*. In this immersive experience, players must strategize and defend the Utopia District from the onslaught of titans that have breached Wall Maria, now threatening the very walls of Wall Rose. 🏰⚔️

## Game Overview

### Setting 🌍
Set in a war-torn world, **Attack on Titan: Utopia** unfolds in the Utopia District, a vital stronghold on the northern border of Wall Rose. After the titans have breached Wall Maria, humanity's survival hangs by a thread. As the commander of the last line of defense, players are tasked with deploying various anti-titan weapons and strategies to prevent the titans from breaking through the walls and obliterating the last bastion of hope. 💪🛡️

### Gameplay Features

- **Endless Tower Defense Mechanics** 🏰: 
  Engage in an endless battle against waves of titans. The game has no winning condition; instead, the objective is to survive for as long as possible while defeating as many titans as you can, with your score increasing based on resources collected from fallen foes. 📈

- **Multi-Lane Battlefield** 🌌: 
  The battlefield is divided into multiple lanes, each featuring a segment of the wall to protect. Players must strategically deploy weapons in these lanes, each with its own health points (HP). If a segment is destroyed, that lane becomes inactive, requiring players to manage their defenses across all active lanes. 🚧

- **Diverse Titan Types** 👹: 
  Face various titans, each with unique attributes and abilities:
    - **Pure Titan**: A basic titan with balanced stats.
    - **Abnormal Titan**: Attacks twice per turn, posing a greater threat.
    - **Armored Titan**: Highly resistant, taking only 25% damage from attacks.
    - **Colossal Titan**: Starts with high HP and increases speed with each turn, becoming a significant danger if not dealt with quickly.

    - **Piercing Cannon**: Attacks the closest five titans within its range.
    - **Sniper Cannon**: Deals heavy damage to the closest titan.
    - **Volley Spread Cannon**: Affects all titans within a specified range.
    - **Wall Trap**: Targets titans that reach the wall directly.

- **Resource Management** 💰: 
  Collect resources by defeating titans, which can then be used to purchase weapons. Managing these resources effectively is crucial to maintaining defenses and ensuring the survival of the Utopia District. 

- **Danger Level System** ⚠️: 
  Each lane has a danger level calculated based on the types and number of titans present. Higher danger levels require more immediate attention and resources to mitigate the threat.
 
### Battle Phases 🔥
The game progresses through three battle phases—Early, Intense, and Grumbling:
- **Early Phase**: Fewer titans with lower danger levels.
- **Intense Phase**: Increased titan strength and frequency.
- **Grumbling Phase**: Dominated by powerful titans, including multiple Colossal Titans.
